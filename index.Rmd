# Purpose

This guide walks secondary reviewers through installing R and its associated packages on their computer. A snapshot of the commands required to run the R packages is available on the "Install or Access R Tools" card on the [Current Report Development Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/E1xXb2uA/current-report-development). Please refer to the [FAQs](#faqs) section for answers to common questions, but note that this section will grow as we move through the process as group. If you still have questions about running R or the secondary review apps, the Integrated Report Team is available and happy to assist you.
